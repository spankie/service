1. buffalo new service
2. add repo remote
3. push to master
4. didn't touch database.yml file; it was in good condition. :)
5. ran: buffalo db create -a
6. ran: buffalo dev (for the first time)
// ran into some errors:
    - database not found
    - didn't run npm install (Using npm instead of yarn)

7. Found out npm had already ran wen buffalo created the application.
8. ran: buffalo db create -a (again)
